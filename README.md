Through this study, it is expected to introduce a deep leaning base for EWS to predict the risk of a cardiac arrest, with practically available information in the Sri Lankan healthcare setup.

## General Objectives ##
To develop a deep learning base for the Early Warning System (EWS) for cardiac patients.

## Specific Objectives ##
  1. Determine the risk score of a cardiac patient.
      1. When a cardiac patient is transferred to the cardiac wards, they are monitored by the hospital staff through observations. Since          the risk of having a second is high, the possible damage which may happen to the patient can reduce through classifying the                patients according to the risk level.
      2. The model will classify the patients once we trained the model.

  2. Identifying the correlation between the input parameters towards the event cardiac arrest. 
      1. When we training the model, the model itself is capable of identifying more relationships between the cardiac arrest and the              input parameters. It is expected from the model to create more correlations between the input parameters and the cardiac arrest            so we can infer more causes for the cardiac arrests.

  3.  Providing an accurate and reliable system to predict in-ward cardiac arrest
